# Rowan Molony's blog

I'm currently working as a software engineer at [`Mainstream Renewable Power`](https://www.mainstreamrp.com/) where I do web development & data engineering.

We use the [`Django`](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework internally for an app called `StationManager`.  This is our portal to sensor measurements (wind speed, temperature etc) from sites all over the world, which are used to decide what renewables (wind or solar and/or energy storage) could be built & where they should go. 

I'm written down here a few things I've picked up along the way.
